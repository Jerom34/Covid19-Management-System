# COVID-19 Management System (CRUD Application)

## Description

Hello! Welcome to my personal project! This desktop application was a recreation of our project from our freshman year as a partial requirement for our Object-Oriented Programming Course. Basically, it is a CRUD Application where a user can create, read, update, and delete a data entry. It also has additional features such as the login system, where a user can add his own user profile. The application utilizes Python as its main programming language, SQL Lite for database creation, and PyQT5 for its graphical user interface framework.
